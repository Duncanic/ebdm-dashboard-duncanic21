## Evidence Summary — key studies (fill PMIDs from PubMed export)
> NOTE: Replace [PMID] with the PubMed ID from your export for each study.

### Study A — Systematic review of physician burnout
- Citation (sample): Rotenstein LS, Torre M, Ramos MA, et al. Prevalence of burnout among physicians: a systematic review. JAMA. 2018;319(5):[page range].
- PMID: [PMID]
- Why selected: High-quality systematic review summarizing prevalence studies across countries and specialties; useful for understanding measurement heterogeneity.
- Key findings (summary): Review reports widely variable prevalence estimates across studies, largely due to differences in instruments and cut-offs; highlights need for standardized measurement when comparing prevalence.
- Relevance to our problem: Demonstrates prevalence uncertainty but confirms burnout is common among healthcare professionals.

### Study B — Instrument development / validation (MBI)
- Citation (sample): Maslach C, Jackson SE. The measurement of experienced burnout. J Occup Behav. 1981;2(2):[page range].
- PMID: [PMID]
- Why selected: Foundational paper describing the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) — the most commonly used instrument in clinical and occupational research.
- Key findings (summary): Describes the three core dimensions (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced personal accomplishment) and psychometric properties of the MBI.
- Relevance: Use MBI scores as primary outcome or to map other instruments to a common framework.

### Study C — Instrument development (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory)
- Citation (sample): Kristensen TS, Borritz M, Villadsen E, Christensen KB. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory: a new tool for the assessment of burnout. Work & Stress. 2005;19(3):[page range].
- PMID: [PMID]
- Why selected: Alternative validated instrument that separates personal, work-related, and client-related burnout.
- Key findings (summary): Presents psychometrics for the CBI and example scoring, useful when studies use different instruments.
- Relevance: Provides a cross-walk for studies using CBI vs MBI.

### Study D — Interventions systematic review (organizational vs individual)
- Citation (placeholder): [Author list]. Systematic review/meta-analysis of interventions to reduce burnout among healthcare professionals. [Journal]. [Year].
- PMID: [PMID]
- Why selected: Compares effectiveness of organizational-level vs individual-level interventions (workload redesign, staffing, schedule changes, vs mindfulness, CBT, resilience training).
- Key findings (summary): Evidence typically shows organizational interventions (workload/staffing/role redesign) produce larger and more sustained reductions in burnout than individual-level approaches alone; however, high heterogeneity and risk of bias exist across trials.
- Relevance: Directly informs intervention selection for your measurement framework (prioritize organizational fixes where feasible).

### Study E — Recent large cohort / prevalence study (example)
- Citation (placeholder): [Author]. Prevalence and predictors of burnout among [profession] in [country]. [Journal]. [Year].
- PMID: [PMID]
- Why selected: Provides recent, context-specific prevalence estimates and identifies local risk factors (e.g., shift length, staffing ratios).
- Key findings (summary): Typical predictors include high workload, low control, low rewards, lack of social support, and poor psychological safety.
- Relevance: Use these predictors to refine local monitoring and interventions.
