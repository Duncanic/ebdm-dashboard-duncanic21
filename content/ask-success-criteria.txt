- **Measurable:** Track compliance through scheduling software and manager check-ins
- **Achievable:** Adjust shift coverage to allow for breaks without affecting patient care
- **Relevant:** Reduces fatigue and burnout
- **Time-bound:** implement within 3 months and evaluate after 6 months

## Measurement Framework
### Quantitative Metrics

Patient outcomes (readmission rates, length of stay, mortality rates).
Patient satisfaction scores (HCAHPS or internal surveys).
Retention rates (percentage of employees staying >1 year).
Utilization of support resources (EAP counseling sessions, wellness program participation).
Employee engagement survey scores (job satisfaction, organizational commitment).
Overtime hours logged per employee.
Healthcare costs related to turnover (recruitment, training, temporary staff).

### Qualitative Indicators

Personal coping strategies staff use to manage stress.
Feedback on wellness programs (What works? What feels ineffective?).
Perceived barriers to reducing burnout (e.g., limited staff, lack of resources, culture of overwork).
Leadership perspectives on retention challenges and solutions.
Suggestions from employees on what organizational changes would help most.
Stories of positive engagement (examples where support improved morale).

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

Leading indicators (early signals)
- Manager training completion rate (%) in target units.
- Participation rate in flexible scheduling pilot (% of eligible staff opting in).
- Pulse survey response rate and early change in intent‑to‑stay (monthly/quarterly).

Lagging indicators (final outcomes)
- 12‑month voluntary turnover rate and burnout prevalence; mean sick‑leave days per employee at 12 months.

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics (example template)
- Baseline period: previous 12 months (adjust if seasonality is present).
- Metric A — Overall burnout among healthcare workers: 50% reported feeling burned out in the past month in 2023 (down from ~54% in 2022)
- Metric B — RN to patient ratio in Virginia: Approx. 10.5 RNs per 1,000 patients
- Metric C — Burnout among VA primary care workers: ~35-42% from 2017-2020; 1-year turnover intention ~31-34%


### Data Collection Plan

- Source systems: HRIS / Payroll (sick days, leavers), LMS or training logs (manager training), Survey platform (Qualtrics/Google Forms), exit interview notes (HR), operational dashboards (workload metrics).
- Frequency: sick‑leave and turnover (monthly extracts; aggregate quarterly), burnout survey (baseline, 6‑month, 12‑month), pulse items (monthly/quarterly).
- Responsible: HR data analyst (extracts and anonymizes), People Analytics (calculates rates), Project lead (interprets findings). Document extraction SQL or column mappings in a data dictionary.

## Success Thresholds

Minimum Acceptable Improvement (floor)
- Sick days: 10% relative reduction at 12 months vs. baseline.
- Turnover: 5% relative reduction at 12 months.
- Burnout prevalence: 10% relative reduction at 12 months.

Target Performance Level (primary goals)
- Sick days: 25% relative reduction at 12 months (primary target for pilot units).
- Turnover: 15% relative reduction at 12 months.
- Burnout prevalence: 20% relative reduction at 12 months.

Stretch Goal (exceptional)
- Sick days: 40% relative reduction; Turnover: 25% reduction; Burnout: 30% reduction.

## Stakeholder‑Specific Success Criteria

Management (senior leadership)
- Demonstrable ROI: reduction in annual recruitment costs and improved service continuity (show cost estimate and approval to scale).

Employees (staff)
- Improved self‑reported wellbeing and intent‑to‑stay; qualitative reports of better workload fairness.

Customers / Service quality
- No deterioration in service KPIs (e.g., average time to resolution) while interventions are piloted; ideally a small improvement.

## Risk Indicators

Red flags (early warning signs)
- No reduction or an increase in sick‑leave or turnover after 6 months.
- Low participation in manager training (<50%) or pilot interventions (<30%).
- Sharp drop in pulse survey response rate (<25%), indicating engagement problems.

Mitigation triggers
- If red flags appear at interim review (6 months), pause scaling; run targeted qualitative interviews to understand causes; adjust intervention fidelity and manager support.

## Timeline for Assessment

Short‑term (30–90 days)
- Deliver manager training to pilot teams; collect baseline HR metrics and run a short pulse survey.

Medium‑term (3–6 months)
- Complete pilot implementation; monitor leading indicators (training completion, pilot participation); run 6‑month burnout survey and interim data checks.

Long‑term (6–12 months)
- Primary outcome evaluation at 12 months (sick days, turnover, burnout prevalence) with cost impact estimation and recommendation on scale‑up.

## Reporting Framework

Dashboard metrics (to display on this dashboard)
- Mean sick days per employee (quarterly)
- Voluntary turnover rate (12‑month rolling)
- Burnout prevalence (%) (baseline / 6m / 12m)
- Intent‑to‑stay (% agree)
- Manager training completion (%) and pilot participation (%)

Regular reports
- Monthly: Leading indicators summary (training completion, participation, pulse highlights) — circulated to project team and HR.
- Quarterly: Dashboard update with quantitative metrics and key qualitative themes — circulated to sponsors and stakeholders.
- 6‑month interim report: progress vs. thresholds, recommended adjustments.
- 12‑month final report: primary outcomes, cost impact, and scale‑up decision.

Milestone reviews
- Week 8: Data & pilot readiness review.
- Month 3: Early check; ensure data flow and initial engagement.
- Month 6: Interim assessment; trigger mitigation if red flags.
- Month 12: Final evaluation and decision on scale.

## Calculation Examples & Quick Formulas

Excel / Spreadsheet formulas
- Mean sick days per employee (unit-level): =SUM(sick_days_range)/COUNT(unique_employee_ids)
- Voluntary turnover (%): =(COUNTIFS(leavers_range, "Voluntary", leavers_date_range, ">" & start_date, leavers_date_range, "<=" & end_date) / average_headcount) * 100

SQL example (simplified)
-- Mean sick days per employee in target unit (last 12 months)
SELECT unit_id,
			 SUM(sick_days) / COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS mean_sick_days
FROM hr_absence
WHERE absence_date BETWEEN '2024-09-22' AND '2025-09-21'
	AND unit_id IN ('unitA','unitB')
GROUP BY unit_id;

## Data Privacy & Quality Notes

- Anonymize individual-level records when reporting (show aggregated metrics only).
- Document data extraction steps and column mappings; keep a versioned data dictionary.
- Account for seasonality and significant organizational events (reorgs, large hiring waves) when interpreting results.

## Next Steps (actionable)

1. Confirm target pilot units and obtain HR data access (fields: employee_id, unit_id, absence_date, absence_type, leaver_flag, leaver_reason).
2. Run baseline extracts for the last 12 months and calculate metric baselines.
3. Deploy manager training and flexible scheduling pilot; track participation and completion.
4. Run monthly dashboard updates; conduct the 6‑month interim analysis and adjust as needed.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Replace placeholder unit names and dates with your organization's specifics.
2. Share baseline numbers (headcount, mean sick days, turnover %) if you want me to convert relative targets into absolute targets.
3. Ask me to add the sample SQL/Excel templates into a separate file for operational reuse.
