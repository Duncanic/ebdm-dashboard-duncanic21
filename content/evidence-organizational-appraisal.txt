# Organizational Evidence: Quality Assessment
## Overall Data Quality Assessment

### Data Source Reliability

#### Primary Data Sources
**Data Source 1:** HR Information System (HRIS)
- **Reliability Rating:** High
- **Data Collection Method:** Automatically captured through HR systems when employees clock in/out, submit leave, or terminate employment
- **Update Frequency:** Daily to weekly, depending on the system.
- **Historical Availability:** 5–10 years of reliable historical data.

**Data Source 2:** Employee Well-Being Surveys / Burnout Surveys
- **Reliability Rating:** Medium-High 
- **Data Collection Method:** Anonymous self-report surveys distributed electronically through platforms like Qualtrics or Press Ganey.
- **Update Frequency:** Annually for engagement surveys; quarterly or semiannually for pulse surveys.
- **Historical Availability:** Usually 2–5 years depending on organization maturity.
- **Known Limitations:** Self-report bias (social desirability, fear of lack of anonymity).

#### Data Integration Assessment
**Cross-System Consistency:** HRIS, EHR, and scheduling systems often operate independently.
**Data Definition Consistency:** Overtime,” “sick leave,” “float coverage,” or “acuity level” may be defined differently across units or systems.
**Temporal Alignment:** Burnout surveys may be annual → may not align with monthly safety or staffing trends.

#### Reliability Assessment
**Measurement Consistency:** 
- **Temporal Stability:** High for HR, scheduling, and EHR metrics — consistent system generation.
- **Inter-Rater Reliability:** Medium — particularly relevant for incident reporting or acuity scoring; differences in interpretation across units can reduce consistency.
- **Internal Consistency:** High for validated burnout instruments (e.g., Maslach Burnout Inventory).

**Error Sources:** 
- **Systematic Errors:** Underreporting of burnout due to stigma or fear of consequences.
- **Random Errors:** Fluctuating patient volumes leading to irregular workload patterns.
- **Human Errors:** Manual data entry mistakes in HR, scheduling edits, or reporting systems.

### Bias Assessment

#### Selection Bias
**Data Availability Bias:** 
- **Risk Level:** medium
- **Issue:** Burnout data (e.g., surveys, self-reports, incident reporting) often has missing responses, especially from the most stressed or overworked staff.
- **Impact:** Missing data can underestimate true burnout levels, making conditions appear better than they are.

**Survivorship Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** high
- **Issue:** Organizational datasets often include only current employees, excluding those who have already left due to burnout, stress, or dissatisfaction.
- **Impact:** This creates a misleading impression that burnout is less severe than reality because the “worst cases” have already exited the system.
