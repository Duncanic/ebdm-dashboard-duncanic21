# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering internal organizational evidence

## Internal Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Identify, measure, and understand the extent, patterns, and drivers of employee burnout within the healthcare organization.
**Secondary Goal:** Assess the feasibility, resource requirements, and expected impact of implementing burnout-reduction interventions

## Available Data Sources

### Performance Metrics/KPIs
- **Financial Data:** overtime expenditures, financial impact of sick leave, budget for intervention programs
- **Operational Data:** Avg timer per patient, staffing ratios, compliance with clinical protocols
- **Human Resources Data:** Engagement survey results, employee well-being, performance review patterns related to stress or burnout
- **Customer Data:** complaints related to service quality, patient satisfaction scores, care. continuity

### Internal Systems
- **CRM Systems:** Patient satisfaction trends, Complaint data indicating care delay or provider stress
- **ERP Systems:** Scheduling data, labor cost tracking, supply chain issues causing interruptions with staff
- **HR Information Systems:** 
**Turnover data:**
Absenteeism and PTO reports
Engagement/wellbeing survey results
Performance evaluations

- **Financial Systems:**
Budget tracking for intervention programs
Cost analysis of staff burnout (overtime, agency staffing, turnover costs)
Financial projections for implementing interventions

- **Operations Systems:** 
Workflow metrics (task time, caseload volumes)
Staffing logs (actual vs. planned coverage)
Incident reporting systems (errors, near misses, safety reports)

### Reports and Documentation

**Regular Reports:**
Monthly staffing & labor reports
Weekly operational dashboards (census, acuity, overtime)
Quarterly quality and safety reports
Annual financial and HR summaries

**Assessment Reports:**

Workflow analysis (time-motion studies)
Unit-level stressor reports
Process evaluations for previous wellbeing or scheduling initiatives

**Historical Studies:**

Prior internal burnout assessments
Previous pilot intervention results (e.g., mindfulness programs, schedule changes)
Organizational climate or workforce studies
Post-incident reviews or crisis assessments (e.g., COVID-era analyses)

**Survey Results:**

Annual or quarterly employee engagement surveys
Burnout-specific pulse surveys
Patient satisfaction surveys
Cultural or psychological safety assessments



## Data Collection Plan

## Quantitative Data Collection
#### Metrics to Collect

**Problem-Related Metrics:**
- Metric 1: [Burnout score] Data source: employee well being surveys/ HR pulse surveys
- Metric 2: [Staff turnover rate] - Current value: X% annually or quarterly - Data source: HR information systems
- Metric 3: [Absenteeism] - Data source: Attendance logs, payroll system, HRIS

**Solution-Related Metrics:**
- Metric 1: [Participation Rate in Burnout Intervention Program] - Data source: [learning management systems, sign in logs]
- Metric 2: [Burnout Score Change (pre/post intervention)] - Data source: Well-being surveys
- Metric 3: [Staffing Ratio Stability / Schedule Variability] - Data source: well being surveys

#### Time Period Analysis
- **Historical Data Range:** 12–24 months of HR, staffing, and patient safety data (to establish trends before intervention).
- **Trend Analysis Period:** Quarterly or monthly
- **Seasonal Considerations:** Winter flu season increases patient volume and burnout risk, Summer staffing shortages, Holidays (higher absenteeism), Residency cycles in teaching hospitals

- **Baseline Period:** The 3–6 months prior to intervention rollout

## Observational Data

- **Process Observations:**
Shift handoff processes
Medication administration workflow
Patient triage during peak times

- **Workflow Analysis:** 
Documenting bottlenecks (e.g., delays in labs or transport)
Mapping tasks performed outside of official job role
Observing physical strain or logistical stressors

- **Communication Patterns:** 
How information flows across shifts and roles
Team cohesion or breakdowns in communication under stress
Escalation pathways during overload

- **Cultural Observations:**
Norms around asking for help
Attitudes toward breaks (skipped meals, working through fatigue)
Leadership visibility and support
Emotional climate on units

## Qualitative Data Collection
Internal Documents Review

- **Policy Documents:** 
Staffing policies and workload allocation guidelines
Mandatory overtime policies
Break and rest period regulations
Employee wellbeing or mental health support policies

- **Meeting Minutes:** 
Unit staff meetings
Nursing leadership councils
Quality & safety committees
HR/Wellbeing steering group discussions

- **Communication Records:** 
Memos on burnout, staffing challenges, or support initiatives
Email communications announcing previous interventions
Leadership updates about organizational stressors


- **Project Reports:** 
Outputs of past burnout, resilience, or scheduling improvement pilots
Results of staff engagement surveys and action plans
Quality improvement reports involving workflow redesign


## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** HR departments, Nursing, medical directors, quality & Safety Office, IT/Data Analytics Team
- **Approval Process:** Institutional approval, IRB Approval, requests through internal data governance process
- **Privacy Considerations:** [What privacy restrictions apply?]
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Use only aggregated, de-identified data, Follow HIPAA rules for any patient-related indicators, Limit access to personal identifiers (only when absolutely necessary)

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** Yes, by protecting anonymity in surveys, interviews, and documentation
- **Data Security:** Use encrypted storage and folloe institutional IT and privacy compliance protocols
- **Use Limitations:** Data used only for burnout assessment and program improvement
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Report only trends, not identifiable incidents
