# Keywords for Employee Burnout (concise table)

This file lists 15 key terms commonly used in research on employee burnout, with short definitions, why each term matters for your review, and example search terms you can use in databases.

| Keyword | Definition | Why it matters for burnout evidence | Example search terms |
|---|---|---|---|
| Burnout | A workplace syndrome of chronic workplace stress leading to exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. | Core outcome; many studies measure or define burnout directly. | "burnout" OR "occupational burnout" |
| Emotional exhaustion | Feeling drained and depleted of emotional resources due to work. | Often the primary subscale in burnout measures (e.g., MBI). | "emotional exhaustion" |
| Depersonalization | Developing a detached or impersonal response toward service recipients or colleagues. | Reflects maladaptive coping and impacts care quality. | "depersonalization" OR "cynicism" |
| Reduced personal accomplishment | Perceiving reduced competence or achievement at work. | One dimension of burnout; influences retention and performance. | "reduced personal accomplishment" OR "reduced efficacy" |
| Occupational stress | Stress arising from work demands and organizational factors. | A proximal exposure often linked causally to burnout. | "occupational stress" OR "job stress" |
| Job strain | High job demands combined with low job control (Karasek model). | A common theoretical exposure associated with burnout risk. | "job strain" OR "job demand control" |
| Workload | Volume or intensity of work tasks required of employees. | Frequently measured as a modifiable risk factor. | "workload" OR "workload intensity" |
| Job control | Degree of autonomy and decision latitude workers have. | Low control moderates stress–burnout relationships. | "job control" OR "decision latitude" |
| Social support | Practical or emotional support from coworkers or supervisors. | Protective factor; common target for interventions. | "social support" AND (work OR workplace) |
| Compassion fatigue | Secondary traumatic stress from caring roles, often in healthcare. | Related but distinct concept often co-occurring with burnout in clinicians. | "compassion fatigue" OR "secondary traumatic stress" |

| Absenteeism | Missed work days due to illness or stress-related reasons. | Common outcome in occupational studies tied to burnout. | "absenteeism" OR "sick leave" |
| Turnover intention | Employee’s reported intent to leave their job. | Proxy for retention problems tied to burnout and job dissatisfaction. | "turnover intention" OR "intent to leave" |
| Recovery / Sleep | Quality and quantity of sleep and off-duty recovery. | Poor recovery is a mediator/moderator for burnout risk. | "sleep" OR "sleep quality" OR "recovery" |


Notes:
- Use the Example search terms column as building blocks when crafting database-specific search strings (combine with Boolean operators and MeSH/subject headings as needed).
- If you'd like, I can convert this to a CSV for import into spreadsheet software or expand each row with suggested database-specific syntax (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL).
