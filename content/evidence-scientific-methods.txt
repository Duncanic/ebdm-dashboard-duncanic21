### Keywords and Search Terms

#### **Primary Keywords**
**Burnout** — A work-related syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (cynicism), and reduced personal accomplishment.
**Emotional exhaustion** — A core dimension of burnout reflecting feelings of being emotionally overextended and depleted of emotional resources.
**Depersonalization (Cynicism)** — A burnout dimension involving detachment, cynicism, or negative attitudes toward work and recipients of one’s work.
**Reduced personal accomplishment (Inefficacy)** — A sense of decreased competence and achievement at work associated with burnout.
**Job strain** — A condition resulting from high job demands combined with low job control, increasing stress and burnout risk.
**Job Demands–Resources (JD‑R) model** — A theoretical framework that explains burnout as the result of high demands and insufficient resources.
**Effort–Reward Imbalance (ERI)** — A model where disproportionate effort relative to rewards (salary, esteem, career opportunities) increases stress and burnout risk.
**Compassion fatigue** — Emotional and physical exhaustion specifically from exposure to suffering in others, common in caregiving professions.
**Vicarious trauma** — Psychological change in caregivers caused by exposure to others’ traumatic experiences, overlapping with burnout symptoms.
**Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)** — A widely used validated instrument measuring exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.
**Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)** — A burnout measure assessing personal, work-related, and client-related burnout dimensions.
**Presenteeism** — Reduced productivity at work due to health problems or burnout despite physical presence at work.
**Absenteeism** — Frequent or prolonged absence from work, often increased by burnout and stress-related illness.
**Allostatic load** — Cumulative physiological wear and tear from chronic stress, linked to burnout through HPA-axis and cardiovascular strain.
**Psychological safety** — A team climate where members feel safe to speak up and seek help, acting as a protective factor against burnout.

### PubMed / MEDLINE search plan (exact strings you can paste into PubMed)
- MeSH-based high-specificity string (use MeSH filter):
  ("Burnout, Professional"[MeSH] OR burnout[tiab] OR "emotional exhaustion"[tiab] OR "depersonalization"[tiab] OR "copenhagen burnout"[tiab] OR "maslach burnout"[tiab])
  AND ("Health Personnel"[MeSH] OR "healthcare"[tiab] OR "health care"[tiab] OR "physician"[tiab] OR "nurse"[tiab] OR employee[tiab])
  Filters: Humans; English; Publication dates 2020:2025; Article types: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, Randomized Controlled Trial, Cohort Study

- Broad sensitivity string (for gray literature & broad capture):
  (burnout OR "emotional exhaustion" OR "compassion fatigue" OR "job strain" OR "presenteeism" OR "absenteeism")
  AND (intervention OR program OR trial OR randomized OR cohort OR prevalence OR cross-sectional)
  Filters: Humans; English; 2020:2025

- Intervention-focused string (organizational interventions):
  (burnout[tiab] OR "burnout, professional"[MeSH]) AND (intervention[tiab] OR program[tiab] OR organizational[tiab] OR workplace[tiab] OR "job design"[tiab] OR staffing[tiab])

- Measurement-focused string (instruments):
  ("Maslach Burnout Inventory"[tiab] OR MBI[tiab] OR "Copenhagen Burnout Inventory"[tiab] OR CBI[tiab] OR "burnout scale"[tiab])

Notes on running searches:
- Use PubMed's "Advanced" search builder to combine MeSH and title/abstract terms to balance sensitivity and specificity.
- Save each search and export results (CSV) with PMID column for reproducibility.

## Screening & Selection Workflow (Practical steps)
1. Run each saved search and export raw results (CSV with PMID, title, authors, year, journal, abstract).
2. Remove duplicates across databases using the PMID column or a reference manager (Zotero, EndNote, Mendeley).
3. Title/abstract screen against inclusion/exclusion criteria (use two independent reviewers where possible; track reasons for exclusion).
4. Retrieve full text for included abstracts; extract data into a CSV extraction form with fields shown in the Evidence Extraction Form above.
5. Optional: run a forward/backward citation check on high-impact articles using PubMed's "Cited by" and "Similar articles" features.

## Data extraction fields (CSV columns to create)
- PMID
- Full citation (APA)
- Year
- Country
- Study design
- Population (profession, sample size)
- Setting (hospital, community, country)
- Instrument used (MBI, CBI, other)
- Key outcomes (prevalence, effect sizes, mean scores)
- Intervention description (if applicable)
- Follow-up duration
- Confounders adjusted
- Funding source / conflict of interest
- Quality checklist scores (see appraisal file)

## Limitations — what I cannot do here
- I don't have live access to PubMed/MEDLINE from this workspace. I prepared exact search strings and a practical workflow above so you (or a librarian) can run reproducible searches and export results. After you paste the exported CSV or a list of PMIDs, I will:
  - Populate `content/evidence-scientific-sources.txt` with full extracted study summaries and accurate citations.
  - Run the quality appraisal template programmatically (or fill it) for each PMID you provide.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be systematic and comprehensive in your approach
2. Document everything so others could replicate your search
3. Focus on research relevant to both your problem AND potential solutions
4. Use library resources and ask librarians for help with database searches
5. Keep detailed records of what you find and why you include/exclude studies
