## Performance Metrics Analysis

### Problem-Related Metrics

#### Metric 1: Employee Turnover Rate
[Metric Name]
- **Current Value:** 18% annual turnover
- **Historical Trend (12 months):** up 2% vs prior year 
- **Benchmark Comparison:** RN turnover in U.S. hospitals is roughly 16.4% (AAG Health Data)
- **Problem Connection:** High turnover may indicate staff dissatisfaction, fatigue, and burnout
- **Data Source:** HRIS (Voluntary separation data)
- **Data Quality:** High — turnover is reliably tracked in HR systems

#### Metric 2: High — turnover is reliably tracked in HR systems
- **Current Value:** Internally among clinical staff 4.5%
- **Historical Trend (12 months):** Increasing (Bereau of labor)
- **Problem Connection:** Elevated absences may reflect stress, burnout, illness, or injuries; if higher than benchmark, suggest internal systemic issues.
- **Data Source:** HR / timekeeping system (payroll, attendance logs)
- **Data Quality:** Depends on accurate absence categorization, and not all absences may be coded as stress-related

- **Key Findings Related to Problem:** 45% of respondents reported moderate or high emotional exhaustion. 30% cited staffing shortages and lack of breaks as top burnout drivers.
- **Key Findings Related to Solution:** High interest in peer-support groups (70%) and flexible scheduling (55%). Barriers to participation: lack of time (62%), skepticism of leadership support (20%).
- **Data Quality Assessment:** Medium — survey used validated scales but had only a 50% response rate.

### Report 2: Safety / Quality Incident Report Summary


- **Report Period: January–December 2024
- **Key Findings Related to Problem: 15% of reported incidents were linked to fatigue or workload (per root-cause analysis). Certain units (ICU, ED) had disproportionately high rates of near-misses per shift.
- **Key Findings Related to Solution: Staff recommended shorter shifts, more staff during peak times, and better handoff processes. Leadership is considering a pilot “just-culture” fatigue management program.
