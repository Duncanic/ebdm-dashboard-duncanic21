## Overall Evidence Quality Assessment

### Data Collection Quality

#### Sample Representativeness
Target Population: 850 healthcare workers (nurses, physicians, techs, support staff)
Sample Size: 312 participants (survey + interviews)
Response Rate: 36.7%
Representativeness Score: Medium
- Clinical roles (nursing, ED techs, ICU staff) were well represented.
- Physicians and non-clinical staff were underrepresented.
- Shift workers (night/weekend) responded at lower rates, which may miss perspectives from high-burnout groups.

Response Quality Indicators
Survey Data Quality
- Complete Responses: 84%
- Partial Responses: 16%
- Average Completion Time: 9 minutes (Expected: 6–12 minutes)
- Skip Rate Per Question: 5–8%, with higher skip rates (10–12%) on questions about emotional exhaustion and management support.

Bias Assessment

Selection Bias Risk Level: Medium–High
Self-Selection Issues- Voluntary Participation Rate: 100% voluntary (no mandatory survey completion)
Characteristics of Non-Respondents: Higher proportion of ED, ICU, and night-shift staff (historically the most burned out). Physicians with heavy caseloads also responded less frequently.
Potential Bias Direction:Results likely underestimate true burnout levels, because the most overwhelmed staff may not have participated.

Sampling Issues
Survey link distributed by email and unit leaders; staff without email access or computer time may be underrepresented.
Geographic Bias: Low (single-site or multi-site but all within same system)
Departmental Bias: Moderate, ED and ICU overrepresented due to strong staff advocacy, Outpatient clinics underrepresented. Administrative staff underrepresented.

Response Bias
Risk Assessment: Medium
Evidence of Bias:
-Some respondents reported concerns about anonymity, especially around management questions.
-Responses trend more positive about direct supervisors than about workload or emotional exhaustion.

Mitigation Used:
-Anonymous survey settings
-No collection of IP addresses
-Clear communication that results are confidential
-Optional open-text responses

Acquiescence Bias
Mild tendency toward mid-range agreement (“Somewhat agree”) on items related to leadership support and staffing, suggesting safe/non-committal answers.
Question Design Assessment:
-Likert scales balanced and non-leading.
-Some reverse-coded items added, but could be expanded to improve internal validity.

Within-Person Consistency
Internal Consistency Checks

Pattern Analysis:
-Most common inconsistency: Reporting low emotional exhaustion but also stating that workload is unmanageable.
-A small number reported high satisfaction but also high intention to leave, suggesting either confusion or social-desirability pressure.
-Very few logical contradictions (e.g., reporting zero overtime but also reporting fatigue due to long hours).
